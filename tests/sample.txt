Sure, I can provide you with simple implementations of the Fibonacci sequence in both C and Python.

#include <stdio.h>
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    else
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int n, i;
    printf("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Fibonacci sequence:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", fibonacci(i));
    }
    return 0;
}

Python Implementation

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

n = int(input("Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: "))
print("Fibonacci sequence:")
for i in range(n):
    print(fibonacci(i), end=" ")

In both implementations, the fibonacci function recursively calculates the Fibonacci sequence.
The C version uses printf and scanf for input and output, while the Python version uses input and print.
Note that these implementations are simple and may not be efficient for large values of n due to the recursive nature,
which leads to repeated calculations. For more efficient implementations, you might want to consider using dynamic programming or memoization techniques.
